[ideally on a PI if you want to build the project to spec.](http://www.quietless.com/kitchen/how-to-setup-node-js-on-a-raspberry-pi/)\n\nMaterials used in this project:\n\n * [Raspberry PI Model B](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)\n * [Arduino Leonardo](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11286)\n * [2x 400 tie pt Breadboards](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9567)\n * [1x Full Length Breadboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/112)\n * [4x74HC595 Shift Registers](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/733)\n * [7-Segment Display - 4-Digit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9481)\n * [24 Leds](http://www.amazon.com/microtivity-IL188-Assorted-Resistors-Colors/dp/B0060FGA8A)\n * [Bunch of Jumper Wires](http://www.amazon.com/Breadboard-jumper-wire-75pcs-pack/dp/B0040DEI9M)\n\nInstallation:\n\n 1. [Follow the schematic to wire everything up](http://quietless.com/docs/node-leds/node-leds.pdf)\n 2. Flash the sketch at /arduino/node-led/node-led.ino onto your Arduino\n 3. Connect the Arduino to your PI\n 4. Fire up the Node server by running the app via > node app\n 5. Point a web browser at the IP address of the PI e.g. 192.168.2.1:8080\n\nAny questions, comments, suggestions open an issue or [post a comment on my blog.](http://www.quietless.com/kitchen/controlling-24-leds-with-node-js-and-a-raspberry-pi/)\n\n\n![Node-LEDS-schematic](http://quietless.com/docs/node-leds/node-leds.png \"Node-LEDS-schematic\")"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1682}]],"length":1682}
